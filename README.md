- 👋 Hi, I’m @Finister-Finn
- 👀 I’m interested in 3d-printing and Dungeons & Dragons.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to install a filament runout sensor on my CR-10 mini. I am failing. Over and over again. In so many new ways!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making the damn thing work again.
- 📫 How to reach me elfinn3@msn.com
